# code-analysis

The aim of this repo is to provide a quick easy tool for running **Code as a Crime Scene** style analytics and putting them into some pretty charts on a locally hosted website.

To run 
```
./run-analysis.sh <git-repository> <codebase-name>
```

This will run the code analysis then start a local server on http://localhost:8090 where you can access the resulting charts.
